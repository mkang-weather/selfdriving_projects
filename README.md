# selfdriving_projects


This repository is a summary of my independent projects on topics in selfdriving. 
Through following projects I have touched on topics in computer vision, deep learning, LIDAR/RADAR sensors, Motion Planning, PID Control, Kalman Filterings, and more. 

### 1. Traffic Sign Classifier

* Extracted key features using HOG gradient, color space in OpenCV
* Trained SVM model to detect and track vehicles in image and video

### 5. Object Detection using sensor data
* With use of Lidar and Radar sensor data estimate position of nearby objects by applyig Kalman Filtering

### 6. Localization
* Localize the position of car based on map and sensor data
